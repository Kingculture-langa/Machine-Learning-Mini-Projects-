# Case Study

A recent 10-year study conducted by a research team at the Great Falls Medical School was conducted to assess how age, systolic blood pressure, and smoking relate to the risk of emphysema. Assume that the data in the file emphysema are from a portion of this study.
Risk is interpreted as the probability (times 100) that the patient will develop emphysema over the next 10-year period. 

For the smoking variable, a dummy variable with 1 indicating a smoker and 0 indicating a nonsmoker
Develop an estimated multiple linear regression equation that relates risk of developing emphysema to the person’s age, systolic blood pressure, and whether the person is a smoker.  

## Questions to be asked and to be answwered
What is the probability of developing emphysema over the next 10 years for Art Speen, a 68year-old smoker who has a systolic blood pressure of 175

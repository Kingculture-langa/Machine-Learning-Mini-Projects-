# This project implements a Logistic Regression model to predict binary outcomes.
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for classification problems,
where the dependent variable takes values such as 0 or 1. The model estimates the probability of an event occurring (e.g., disease presence vs. absence, churn vs. retention) based on input features, using the logistic (sigmoid) function to map predictions between 0 and 1
